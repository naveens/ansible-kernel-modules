sigma.kernel-modules
====================

Basic blacklisted/disabled modules management

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: "sigma.kernel-modules"
           disabled_modules:
           - nfsv4
